# Project 2: Roomba Auto Obstacle Avoidance:
1\ The code is created using Matlab 2017 a, so it could not function properly with other versions.

2\ Initally folow all the setup steps from the video above.

3\ Its possible to add the the library provided in the folder (project 2) to your library browser by folowing the instructions in the link below:

https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/93939-how-do-i-add-a-custom-library-to-the-simulink-library-browser-in-simulink-4-1-r12-1

4\ Then make sure the file RoombaInit_wifi.m is in the same directory you are workink from.

5\ Then run the test file.

6\ on/off to switch on and off.

7\ IR Sensor block to read the IR values.

8\ Battery Sensor block to provide the emergency stop function (if the battery is less than 10% stop and don't continue until its 15%).

9\ WheelControl automatically contols the roomba's movement and avoid any obstecals based on the IR values provided.
